Just a college assignment
# Assumptions Taken:--
* Whenever a customer is initiating a refund, if the order is unprepared whenever admin sees the 
   order, admin automatically refunds the money.
* There is no mentioning of predefined input in the GC or in the Statement of the Assignment-3.
  Due to which, I haven't added predefined items and customers.
* There are 3 types of customers VIP, Regular and Anonymous or Guest, I have given VIP a separate privilege.
* VIP orders will be visible first, I have left it on choice of the admin whether He is preparing food of VIP 
or delivering the Order of Regular User as there are many stages, It is possible that VIP just ordered after 
the order of someone was dispatched, hence his order will get completed first instead of VIP's.
Due to which is the choice and the intelligence of the admin which deal's these kinds of situations.
